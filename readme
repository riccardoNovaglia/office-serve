The entry point for the application is the GameTracker.scala class.

It uses the InputParser to transform hex input into Events, and the GameState to keep track of the state of the game 
and consistency.

I've added a test class called DataValidationSpec which parses the two provided sample files and proves 
that the first one is parsed correctly, and the second one is parsed throwing exception for inconsistent inputs.

It was developed in IntelliJ using scala 2.11.8 and sbt 0.13.13
